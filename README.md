# claudeai-roguelike
Building a ruguelike in python using claude-ai and not touching code except to copy-paste it in.

# WHY
I think its great, and I am having fun trying to learn python and also prompt engineering.  I saw claude 3 was pretty well versed at programming, so I gave it a shot.  This way I can also participate in the open-source community and blame the AI for bad and insecure code instead of me.

# FACEPALM
This is probably my fifth iteration, and my prompt is pretty giant. Hoping to find out just what we can build with this thing.  
It runs in a terminal because claude starts to get confused when you add too much pygame math.

# WHAT WORKS
- Inventory, you can have weapons and armor
- Chests, you can loot for said weapons and armor
- Monsters you can fight and gain experience and level up
- Land that is dynamically generated, that you can explore - it's so totally "open world" bruhh
- Save and reload your game where you left off
- Towns and paths between towns
- .. its just .. you know - for fun.
