# claudeai-roguelike
Building a ruguelike in python using claude-ai and not touching code except to copy-paste it in.

# WHY
I think its great, and I am having fun trying to learn python and also prompt engineering.  I saw claude 3 was pretty well versed at programming, so I gave it a shot.

# FACEPALM
This is probably my fifth iteration, and my prompt is pretty giant. Hoping to find out just what we can build with this thing.  
It runs in a terminal because claude starts to get confused when you add too much pygame math.
